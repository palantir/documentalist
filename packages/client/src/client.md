@# Client

Now that you've compiled a sweet data file packed with documentation goodness, what next?

Well, you've got some options. This package does not provide the tools to render the data, but they're fairly easy to construct once you understand the data format. The `@documentalist/client` package provides functions, interfaces, and type guards for working with the output of the compiler.

-   Check out the private [`@documentalist/docs` package](https://github.com/palantir/documentalist/tree/develop/packages/docs) for our simple Pug template that renders the [GitHub Pages site](http://palantir.github.io/documentalist).
-   Blueprint publishes a React theme in the [`@blueprintjs/docs-theme`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/docs-theme) package (the same one that powers https://blueprintjs.com/docs).

 * A Documentalist plugin is an object with a `compile(files, compiler)` function

 * to accept options.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Compiler, File, Plugin } from "documentalist/client";
 *
 * export interface MyData {
 *     pluginName: { ... }
 * }
 *
 * export interface MyOptions {
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * export class MyPlugin implements Plugin<MyData> {
 *     public constructor(options: MyOptions = {}) {}
 *
 *     public compile(files: File[], compiler: Compiler) {
 *         return files.map(transformToMyData);
 *     }
 * }
